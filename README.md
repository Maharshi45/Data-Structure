# Data-Structure
## Arrays
Contiguous block in memory
Every element occupies the same amount of space in memory
if an array starts at memory address x, and the size of each element in array is y, we can calculate the memory address of ith element by using following expression: x + i * y
if we know the index of an element, the time to retrieve the element will be the same, no matter where it is in the array
